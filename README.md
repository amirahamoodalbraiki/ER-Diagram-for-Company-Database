# ER-Diagram-for-Company-Database

# Company Database mapping Schema

# Database Implementation (DDL)


This project contains a complete relational database schema based on an ER diagram for a company system. It includes employees, departments, projects, and dependents.

âœ… Structured using ER-to-Relational Mapping rules  
âœ… All relationships and attributes are clearly represented  
âœ… Includes derived tables for multivalued attributes, weak entities, and M:N relationships


In this phase, the ER diagram and relational schema were transformed into real SQL tables using DDL (Data Definition Language) commands.

âœ… All tables were created using `CREATE TABLE`  
âœ… Primary and foreign keys are clearly defined  
âœ… Constraints like `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, and `UNIQUE` ensure data integrity  
âœ… Recursive, 1:N, and M:N relationships are implemented using foreign keys and bridge tables  
ðŸ›  Compatible with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
